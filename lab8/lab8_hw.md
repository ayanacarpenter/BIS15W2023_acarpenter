## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.  

Make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  

## Load the libraries

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Install `here`
The package `here` is a nice option for keeping directories clear when loading files. I will demonstrate below and let you decide if it is something you want to use.  

```r
#install.packages("here")
```

## Data
For this homework, we will use a data set compiled by the Office of Environment and Heritage in New South Whales, Australia. It contains the enterococci counts in water samples obtained from Sydney beaches as part of the Beachwatch Water Quality Program. Enterococci are bacteria common in the intestines of mammals; they are rarely present in clean water. So, enterococci values are a measurement of pollution. `cfu` stands for colony forming units and measures the number of viable bacteria in a sample [cfu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit).   

This homework loosely follows the tutorial of [R Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/). If you get stuck, check it out!  

1. Start by loading the data `sydneybeaches`. Do some exploratory analysis to get an idea of the data structure.

```r
sydneybeaches <- readr::read_csv("data/sydneybeaches.csv")
```

```
## Rows: 3690 Columns: 8
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (4): Region, Council, Site, Date
## dbl (4): BeachId, Longitude, Latitude, Enterococci (cfu/100ml)
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

```r
glimpse(sydneybeaches)
```

```
## Rows: 3,690
## Columns: 8
## $ BeachId                   <dbl> 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, …
## $ Region                    <chr> "Sydney City Ocean Beaches", "Sydney City Oc…
## $ Council                   <chr> "Randwick Council", "Randwick Council", "Ran…
## $ Site                      <chr> "Clovelly Beach", "Clovelly Beach", "Clovell…
## $ Longitude                 <dbl> 151.2675, 151.2675, 151.2675, 151.2675, 151.…
## $ Latitude                  <dbl> -33.91449, -33.91449, -33.91449, -33.91449, …
## $ Date                      <chr> "02/01/2013", "06/01/2013", "12/01/2013", "1…
## $ `Enterococci (cfu/100ml)` <dbl> 19, 3, 2, 13, 8, 7, 11, 97, 3, 0, 6, 0, 1, 8…
```

If you want to try `here`, first notice the output when you load the `here` library. It gives you information on the current working directory. You can then use it to easily and intuitively load files.

```r
library(here)
```

```
## here() starts at /Users/ayanacarpenter/Desktop/BIS15W2023_acarpenter
```

The quotes show the folder structure from the root directory.

```r
sydneybeaches <-read_csv(here("lab8", "data", "sydneybeaches.csv")) %>% janitor::clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 3690 Columns: 8
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (4): Region, Council, Site, Date
## dbl (4): BeachId, Longitude, Latitude, Enterococci (cfu/100ml)
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

2. Are these data "tidy" per the definitions of the tidyverse? How do you know? Are they in wide or long format?

This data is in long format which is considered tidy by the tidyverse. I know this because each different date results in repeats of the beaches. 

3. We are only interested in the variables site, date, and enterococci_cfu_100ml. Make a new object focused on these variables only. Name the object `sydneybeaches_long`

```r
sydneybeaches_long <- sydneybeaches %>% 
  select(site, date, enterococci_cfu_100ml)
```

4. Pivot the data such that the dates are column names and each beach only appears once. Name the object `sydneybeaches_wide`

```r
sydneybeaches_wide <- sydneybeaches_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = date, values_from = enterococci_cfu_100ml)
```


5. Pivot the data back so that the dates are data and not column names.

```r
sydneybeaches_new <- sydneybeaches_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(-site, 
               names_to = "date",
               values_to = "enterococci_cfu_100ml")
```


6. We haven't dealt much with dates yet, but separate the date into columns day, month, and year. Do this on the `sydneybeaches_long` data.

```r
sydneybeaches_separate <- sydneybeaches_long %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("day", "month", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  group_by(site, year)
```


7. What is the average `enterococci_cfu_100ml` by year for each beach. Think about which data you will use- long or wide.


```r
mean_enterococci_cfu <- sydneybeaches_separate %>% 
  summarize(mean_enterococci_cfu_ml = mean(enterococci_cfu_100ml, na.rm=T))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'site'. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.
```

8. Make the output from question 7 easier to read by pivoting it to wide format.


```r
mean_enterococci_cfu %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              values_from = mean_enterococci_cfu_ml)
```

```

```

9. What was the most polluted beach in 2018?

South Maroubra Rockpool was the most polluted beach in 2018. 
I know there has to be a better way to select the highest value under the year 2018 but I could not figure it out. 

```r
most_polluted_2018 <- mean_enterococci_cfu %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              values_from = mean_enterococci_cfu_ml) %>% 
  select(site, 7) 
most_polluted_2018
```

```
## # A tibble: 11 × 2
## # Groups:   site [11]
##    site                    `2018`
##    <chr>                    <dbl>
##  1 Bondi Beach              22.9 
##  2 Bronte Beach             43.4 
##  3 Clovelly Beach           10.6 
##  4 Coogee Beach             21.6 
##  5 Gordons Bay (East)       17.6 
##  6 Little Bay Beach         59.1 
##  7 Malabar Beach            38.0 
##  8 Maroubra Beach            9.21
##  9 South Maroubra Beach     12.5 
## 10 South Maroubra Rockpool 112.  
## 11 Tamarama Beach           15.5
```



```r
most_polluted_2018 <- most_polluted_2018 %>% 
  filter(site == "South Maroubra Rockpool")
```
