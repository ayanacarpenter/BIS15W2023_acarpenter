## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

A bachelors degree is needed to be a data scientist. 
Data science is a growing occupation. 


2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

I would list the software that I am experienced in using and then follow with skills that are essential to analyzing data. For example I may say that I am experienced in R programming and comfortable with cleaning, analyzing, and sorting through data to form conclusions. 


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)

I am interested in data science as a career and the skills I've learned in this class through R have helped me learn how to construct plots and manage large data sets. The skills I've learned from this class have opened my eyes to all of the potential projects I can begin to engage in with data. 


4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

I think remembering all of the endless functions has been the most difficult for me. It can also be difficult to see when the data needs to be pivoted for me. At the end of an assignment though, it is very rewarding to hit the knit button and finish with code that runs smoothly. 


5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I think this class is a really good introductory course to using R. Never having used R myself, I was very pleased to see that the instructors had not expected us to be familiar with R. I have only taken BIS 2B though, and I wished that I had a bit more biology knowledge before working with some of the data sets because I would understand more variables in the data prior to working with the data sets. 


6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

With one more class I wish that we could spend time looking at data projects that are possible in R, ranging from advanced to beginner. I also feel that data science is not a career that many people talk about, so if there was a class where we could see the average amount of work and the type of tasks that take place in a data scientist's day it would also be very useful. 


7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

With new skills in R, this class has encouraged me to begin thinking of a project of my own to begin a data-based project. I am going to familiarize myself with more programming languages through other courses at this school and with taking this class, I have also debated between declaring a new major that would allow me to work hands on with data. 


8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I found it comforting to have a partner right next to me to turn to when my code chunk wouldn't work, or when I wanted to compare our codes. I think this class works best in person as you can get immediate help from the people right around you. I think if this class were online I would fall behind more easily because I imagine being more easily distracted on a video call like zoom, and I think I would likely miss a lot of important instructions.
